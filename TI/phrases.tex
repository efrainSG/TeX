\subsection{was/were + present participle sentences}
\begin{multicols}{2}

The present participle is formed by adding the ending ``â€“ing'' to the infinitive (dropping any silent ``e'' at the end of the infinitive):

\begin{itemize}
\item The present participle may often function as an adjective: That's an interesting book.
\item The present participle can be used as a noun denoting an activity (this form is also called a gerund): Swimming is good exercise.
\item The present participle can indicate an action that is taking place, although it cannot stand by itself as a verb. In these cases it generally modifies a noun (or pronoun), an adverb, or a past participle: Washing clothes is not my idea of a job.
\item The present participle is used in progressive verb tenses, which indicate continuing actions or actions in progress (the present progressive, the future progressive, the present perfect progressive): I am eating my dinner. He was walking across the park. We will be calling you tomorrow.
\item The present participle may be used with ``while'' or ``by'' to express an idea of simultaneity (``while'') or causality (``by''): He finished dinner while watching television. By using a dictionary he could find all the words. While speaking on the phone, she doodled. By calling the police you saved my life!
\item The present participle of the auxiliary ``have'' may be used with the past participle to describe a past condition resulting in another action: Having spent all his money, he returned home. Having told herself that she would be too late, she accelerated.
