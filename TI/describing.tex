\section{Describing myself}

\subsection{Who am I?}
\begin{multicols}{2}
My name is Efrain and I like programming. I'm a software developer and I've worked on different administrative apps, moreover, I've worked for different companies in different places therefore I have knowledge of different languages and tools thanks to I had roles as back-end and front-end. Therefore, most of my knowledge was aquired through live experience instead of courses.\\
I hope someday create intelligent apps because my dream related to programming is to create technology that ease software development or develop some videogames.\\
I have experience as professor at a private university. I teached about networking, programming and databases, besides, I'd also have liked to teach methodology of researching or maths.\\
I love maths and I have interest in different physics concepts. I'd like to create a few robots.\\
Currently I have a lot of things to do inside my head and I'd like I could realize them.

\subsection{What are my capabilities? (nor related to work neither hobbies)}
\begin{multicols}{2}
My experience as professor allows me to teach others effectively, moreover, I can write small articles and essays, also, because of that experience, I'm capable to speak out to audiences, of course, having the context and waht to say. I can make handicrafts. I can make artistic and technical drawings. I can learn quickly.

\subsection{About time sparing}
\begin{multicols}{2}
I can't do many sports because a back injury, therefore I can do only swimming furthermore I love it, I love the feeling of freedom when I move in the water, I love how far I can go without pain.\\
I'd like practice karate to help my family and maybe teach my son and daugther, although I can't do most of the techniques, regardless of that, I'd try to develop a defense that help them to cope with bulliers.\\
Since my master degreee course, I like wrinting, consequently I put all my writings into one file and I created a small book. Now, my goal is to edit all my writings and create better articles and essays.\\
I like reading books. I've been reading books, articles and novels since I was very young. Sometimes I can feel how the story captures me too deep that I can't feel time passing. In other readings, the author makes me travel through the universe from and back to my seat and my mind blows up. Have you watched the first movie of Matrix? Do you remember how Neo feels when he recieves the first dose of digital knowledge? Sometimes I have a similar feeling and is delightful.\\
I like painting, but has been a while since my last painting.
I used to paint landscapes and I feel I'm not good enought to draw and paint human bodies. I was studying to paint when I was youngh and I had more leisure. I know how to paint using pencil colors and oil paint but I know that I need to improve that skill perhaps, in few time I'll restart my old hobby because I loved it and I miss to do that.\\
On the other hand\dots
I like travel.
I like go out to different, and maybe unknown, places.
I enjiy viewing different things and possibly buy few small stuffs, not very expensive but beautiful things, also, I like to taste different food and to take some photos.
Actually I don't feel I could do that without creatin a new debt and that makes me feel sad. Really I'd like to travel again and feel not worries about the money, to feel a comfortable place to sleep and wake up early to go breakfast, try a new place to eat and where to go dinner. I'd like to travel and visit new places and return to home completly relaxed.\\
Also, I like to be well dressed. I used to wear formal shirt everyday because of my previous jobs and I liked. I reached to have thirty different shirts with a lot of different ties, four suits, two pair of shoes, more than ten polo style t-shirts.
I really miss these manner to dress. I, actually, have just one suit, 7 shirts and one pair of shoes. Of course, talking about formal clothes.\\

\subsection{My old habits}

\subsection{What projects did I do?}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{description}
\item[Lematizer]
\item[Di-JAVA]
\item[Dextra] This was a management sysem for universities. It was developed using a three layer architecture with SQL Server 2008 as DBMS, Linq as  its ORM and WPF for the user interfaces. The rest of the application was developed as a Class Library. Dextra used .NET Framework 3.5 and 4. Also, it had a small part designed using the Factory pattern. Additional, the system had a small web platform where teachers could register evaluation scores for their students, their plannings and rules for each course, also they could update their profiles, consult their schedules, administrative personel could look up for evaluations, plannings, course rules and do another tasks, and studens could review their evaluations, schedules, plannings and rules for each course they was taking. That system took me two years to be completed because the whole project was developed only by myself.
\item[Library system]
\item[Cotediv] This was designed to be a ludic educational project combining a few characteristics based on FaceBook, Twitter, and mind maps systems. For that last element it required a language process to link the information. The system was developed using PHP, JavaScript and mySQL, but none frameworks was used. The system allows to the participants to take questionnaires and test to get points, also each concept published (the main purpose) could be valuated and evaluated by other participants and professors allowing to the participants to get more points and follow up their progress as ranking tables and automated mind maps.
\item[Clinic stories]
